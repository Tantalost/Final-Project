Are books like Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code and Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl the Gladwellian outliers of publishing?

    "description": "Writer F. Scott Fitzgerald's career itself is a metaphor for the vagaries of book publishing. If Fitzgerald would have had his way, we would today refer to The Great Gatsby as either Gold-Hatted Gatsby, Trimalchio in West Egg, or The High-Bouncing Lover. A few years before Gatsby, Fitzgerald had become a literary sensation at the age of 23; Helen Hooven Santmyer, a contemporary of Fitzgerald's, would not have a successful novel published until she was 88 and living in a nursing home. In this book, the author explores that mysterious place in publishing where art and commerce can either clash, mesh, or both. Along the way, a wide range of authors--from the literary greats to today's commercial superstars--editors, agents and publishers share their thoughts, insights and experiences: What inspires writers? (John Steinbeck, for example, wrote every novel as if it were his last, as if death were imminent.) Why are some books successful and appreciated, while others fall into oblivion? The answers are often elusive, never absolute, but the stories and anecdotes are always fascinating.",

    "description": "\"When a story captures the imagination of millions, that's magic. Can you qualify magic? Archer and Jockers just may have done so.\"\u2014Sylvia Day, New York Times bestselling author Ask most people about massive success in the world of fiction, and you\u2019ll typically hear that it\u2019s a game of hazy crystal balls. The sales figures of E. L. James or Dan Brown seem to be freakish\u2014random occurrences in an unknowable market. But what if there were an algorithm that could reveal a secret DNA of bestsellers, regardless of their genre? What if it knew, just from analyzing the words alone, not just why genre writers like John Grisham and Danielle Steel belong on the lists, but also that authors such as Junot Diaz, Jodi Picoult, and Donna Tartt had telltale signs of success all over their pages? Thanks to Jodie Archer and Matthew Jockers, the algorithm exists, the code has been cracked, and the results bring fresh new insights into how fiction works and why we read. The Bestseller Code offers a new theory for why Fifty Shades of Grey sold so well. It sheds light on the current craze for dark heroines. It reveals which themes tend to sell best. And all with fascinating supporting data taken from a five-year study of twenty thousand novels. Then there is the hunt for \"the one\"\u2014the paradigmatic example of bestselling writing according to a computer's analysis of thousands of points of data. The result is surprising, a bit ironic, and delightfully unorthodox. This book explains groundbreaking text-mining research in accessible terms and offers a new perspective on the New York Times bestseller list. It's a big-idea book about the relationship between creativity and technology that will be provocative to anyone interested in how analytics have already transformed the worlds of finance, medicine, and sports. But at heart it is a celebration of books for readers and writers\u2014a compelling investigation into how successful writing works, and a fresh take on our intellectual and emotional response to stories.",

    "description": "Get an inside look at the detailed investigations of the United States Congress, the groundwork for Donald Trump\u2019s win in 2016, and the events that occurred during his successful four years as president. When I woke up on October 2, 2020, I figured it would be like most Fridays in DC. Congress would finish up the week with a few votes on the House Floor and then members would rush to Reagan National Airport to catch a flight home. Polly and I had a mid-afternoon flight; however, we weren\u2019t headed home. We were going to Wisconsin to help a colleague raise funds and to attend the President\u2019s rally in Green Bay\u2026. As I started to put on my workout gear before heading to the House gym, I took a look at my phone. I noticed I had several text messages and missed phone calls from Russell Dye, the top media staffer for our personal office and for Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee. Some of the calls and messages were from after midnight\u2026. I called him right away. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked. He responded, \u201cSir, the president has the virus!\u201d I turned on the TV. It was the only story.\u2026 I had traveled to Cleveland with the president three days earlier\u2014I knew I\u2019d have to quarantine until I got tested. I\u2019d been tested before the flight to Cleveland, but that wouldn\u2019t matter now. I\u2019d have to get a new test. No workout this morning, no flight to Wisconsin this afternoon\u2026. First things first. I was scheduled for a Fox and Friends interview that morning in the eight o\u2019clock hour. I grabbed a quick shower and then headed to the office to prep for the interview. We were supposed to discuss the election and how the president was doing in Ohio. But we knew the only topic would be the president contracting the virus\u2026. An hour later I got tested in the House physician\u2019s office.\u2026 On that drive home Polly and I talked about all that had transpired that morning. We talked about the president and first lady, and like millions of other Americans, we prayed for their health and for our country. Over the weekend I thought about that day\u2014that one day\u2014Friday, October 2, 2020: it was really a picture of the entire year. 2020 was about the virus and the presidential election. 2020 was all about politics.",

    "description": "From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, The Way of Kings, Book One of the Stormlight Archive, begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion. Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable. Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity. Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war. The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making. Speak again the ancient oaths: Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before Destination. and return to men the Shards they once bore. The Knights Radiant must stand again.

Growing up in a small town and never quite fitting in, Zade is determined to forge her own path. She leaves her home in Tennessee to break free from her overprotective mother Dela, the local resident spellcaster and fortuneteller. Zade travels to Las Vegas and uses supernatural powers to become part of a premiere magic show led by the infamous magician Charles Spellman. Zade fits right in with his troupe of artists and misfits. After all, when everyone is slightly eccentric, appearing 'normal' is much less important. Behind the scenes of this multimillion-dollar production, Zade finds herself caught in a love triangle with Mac, the show's good-looking but rough-around-the-edges technical director and Jackson, the tall, dark, handsome and charming bandleader. Zade's secrets and the struggle to choose between Mac or Jackson creates reckless tension during the grand finale of the show. Using Chaos magick, which is known for being unpredictable, she tests her abilities as a spellcaster farther than she's ever tried and finds herself at death's door. Her fate is left in the hands of a mortal who does not believe in a world of real magick, a fortuneteller who knew one day Zade would put herself in danger and a dagger with mystical powers\"--Amazon.com",

And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams.\" Every few decades a book is published that changes the lives of its readers forever. The Alchemist is such a book. With over a million and a half copies sold around the world, The Alchemist has already established itself as a modern classic, universally admired. Paulo Coelho's charming fable, now available in English for the first time, will enchant and inspire an even wider audience of readers for generations to come. The Alchemist is the magical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure as extravagant as any ever found. From his home in Spain he journeys to the markets of Tangiers and across the Egyptian desert to a fateful encounter with the alchemist. The story of the treasures Santiago finds along the way teaches us, as only a few stories have done, about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, above all, following our dreams.",

''Simultaneously reads like a thriller and like a strange, dreamlike excursion into the subconscious.\" \u2014Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times \"Thrillingly alive, sublimely creepy, distressingly scary, breathtakingly intelligent\u2014it renders most other fiction meaningless.\" \u2014Bret Easton Ellis, bestselling author of American Psycho \u201cThis demonically brilliant book is impossible to ignore.\u201d \u2014Jonathan Lethem, award-winning author of Motherless Brooklyn One of The Atlantic\u2019s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years Years ago, when House of Leaves was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth\u2014musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies\u2014the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children. Now made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and second and third appendices, the story remains unchanged. Similarly, the cultural fascination with House of Leaves remains as fervent and as imaginative as ever. The novel has gone on to inspire doctorate-level courses and masters theses, cultural phenomena like the online urban legend of \u201cthe backrooms,\u201d and incredible works of art in entirely unrealted mediums from music to video games. Neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of the impossibility of their new home, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story\u2014of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.",

From a former marine and Yale Law School graduate now serving as a U.S. Senator from Ohio and the Republican Vice Presidential candidate for the 2024 election, an incisive account of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town that offers a broader, probing look at the struggles of America's white working class. THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \"You will not read a more important book about America this year.\"--The Economist \"A riveting book.\"--The Wall Street Journal \"Essential reading.\"--David Brooks, New York Times Hillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis--that of white working-class Americans. The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck. The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.'s grandparents were \"dirt poor and in love,\" and moved north from Kentucky's Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that J.D.'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history. A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.",

    "description": "In the world of books and literature, \u201chype\u201d is associated with bestsellerism - the books that sell the most, are read by vast numbers, and constantly talked about in media and staff rooms. Often, it is the success in itself that generates an interest because popularity begets popularity. Quite often though, a hyped bestseller is met with a skeptic criticism of poor language, a badly constructed plot, a predictable story line, or all three. The bestseller phenomenon is sometimes conceived as a threat against \u201creal\u201d literature. Research into the creation, reception, and meaning of bestsellers is utterly scarce and Hype: Bestsellers and Literary Culture is an important contribution to the understanding of the literature read by the masses. Popular literature plays an important role in the lives of millions of readers, offering entertainment, social commentary, and alternate perspectives on everyday life. This volume brings together such diverse issues as the creation of hype, the role and the meaning of the author in the present-day media landscape, changes in the book trade, and the relationship between bestsellers and research into them. Further articles give an historical overview on postapocalyptic stories, desert romances and the role of the authors. This book offers new knowledge on a subject that is increasingly popular within university curricula. Although the anthology is a work of academic research the texts are of equal interest to general readers.",

    "description": "Cultural Capitalism explores Russian literature's eager embrace of capitalism in the post-Soviet era. When the Soviet Union fell, books were suddenly bought and sold as commodities. Russia's first bestseller lists brought attention and prestige. Even literary prizes turned to the market for legitimacy. The rise of capitalism entirely transformed both the economics and the aesthetics of Russian literature. By reconstructing the market's influence on everything from late-Soviet paper shortages to the prose of neoimperialism, Cultural Capitalism reveals Russian literature's exuberant hopes for and deep disappointments in capitalism. Only a free market, it was hoped, could cure endemic book deficits and liberate literature from ideological constraints. But as the market came to dominate literature, it imposed an ideology of its own, one that directed literary development for decades. Through archival research, original interviews, and provocative readings of literary texts, Bradley A. Gorski immerses the reader in both the economic and aesthetic worlds of post-Soviet Russian literature to reveal a cultural logic dominated by capitalism. The Russian 1990s and early 2000s saw markets introduced, adopted, and debated at an accelerated pace, all against the backdrop of a socialist past, staging the polemics between capitalism and culture in high drama and sharp relief. But the market forces at the center of the post-Soviet transition are fundamental to cultural trends worldwide. By revealing the complexities of Russia's story, Cultural Capitalism mounts a critique that cuts across national borders and provides a new way of seeing culture in the post-1989 era worldwide.",

We live in an era when book clubs, bibliomemoirs, Bookstagram and BookTok are as valuable to some readers as solitary reading moments. The product of nearly two decades of qualitative research into readers and reading culture, What Readers Do examines reading through three dimensions - aesthetic conduct, moral conduct, and self-care \u0096 to show how readers intertwine private and social behaviors, and both reinforce and oppose the structures of capitalism. Analyzing reading as a post-digital practice that is a synthesis of both print and digital modes and on- and offline behaviors, Driscoll presents a methodology for studying readers that connects book history, literary studies, sociology, and actor-network theory. Arguing for the vitality, agency, and creativity of readers, this book sheds light on how we read now - and on how much more readers do than just read.",

    "description": "From bestselling author Jon Gordon comes a spiritual fable about the power of faith, hope, and love Meet Jay and Kay. They\u2019re twins, and like many teenagers their age, they\u2019re dealing with stress and anxiety. One day on their way to school, they have a nice conversation with their old family friend and youth soccer coach, Mr. Erwin, who shows them a special garden he created in his backyard. The garden serves as both a place and a metaphor for Mr. Erwin to share a powerful paradigm and practical strategies to help the twins overcome their fear, stress, and anxiety. The Garden is an enlightening and encouraging spiritual fable that reveals the 5 D\u2019s that can sabotage us and a proven plan to help us overcome and win the battle in our mind. Rooted in Jon Gordon\u2019s faith tradition, this fable is a different kind of book than his previous business fables. However, in his familiar trademark style, he takes a complex subject and simplifies it to help people take action and improve their lives. Everyone will struggle with fear, anxiety, or stress at some point in their lives, and everyone will have to overcome these challenges to create the life they were meant to live. Given that there are many contributing factors that influence how we think and feel, Jon wrote this book to share how the power of love, encouragement, truth, faith, and belief can be part of the solution. Having worked with countless leaders, companies, sports teams, professional athletes, and high school students, Jon Gordon infuses this life-changing story with thought-provoking ideas, practical strategies, and a framework to overcome fear with faith. Whether you are dealing with fear, stress, and anxiety yourself, have a family member that struggles, or are a mental health expert that works with clients, if any of the ideas in this book can be useful to you or the people you love and care about, then it\u2019s worth a walk through The Garden with Jay, Kay, and Mr. Erwin to discover ways to persevere through life with the power of faith, hope, and love.",

    "description": "Children's book awards have mushroomed since the early twentieth-century and especially since the 1960s, when literary prizing became a favored strategy for both commercial promotion and canon-making. There are over 300 awards for English-language titles alone, but despite the profound impact of children\u2019s book awards, scholars have paid relatively little attention to them. This book is the first scholarly volume devoted to the analysis of Anglophone children's book awards in historical and cultural context. With attention to both political and aesthetic concerns, the book offers original and diverse scholarship on prizing practices and their consequences in Australia, Canada, and especially the United States. Contributors offer both case studies of particular awards and analysis of broader trends in literary evaluation and elevation, drawing on theoretical work on canonization and cultural capital. Sections interrogate the complex and often unconscious ideological work of prizing, the ongoing tension between formalist awards and so-called identity-based awards \u2014 all the more urgent in light of the \"We Need Diverse Books\" campaign \u2014 the ever-morphing forms and parameters of prizing, and scholarly practices of prizing. Among the many awards discussed are the Pura Belpr\u00e9 Medal, the Inky Awards, the Canada Governor General Literary Award, the Printz Award, the Best Animated Feature Oscar, the Phoenix Award, and the John Newbery Medal, giving due attention to prizes for fiction as well as for non-fiction, poetry, and film. This volume will interest scholars in literary and cultural studies, social history, book history, sociology, education, library and information science, and anyone concerned with children's literature.",

    "description": "Why do some fashion organizations succeed and others don\u2019t? How do the best fashion brands achieve long lasting success? What do the best fashion companies do that set them apart? Why some companies make it to the top only to go bankrupt a few years later? Is fashion dying? Some seem to think so. Or is it merely a matter of mismanagement? Ralph Lauren closed his flagship Polo store. But Amancio Ortega\u2019s fashion empire is still strong, making him one of the richest men in the entire world across all industries. In this book, we will examine what makes a great fashion company and brand. We look at five key dynamics from various perspectives: \u2022 Leadership \u2022 Problem solving \u2022 Vision \u2022 How we see our people \u2022 Building creativity and innovation There is no magic bullet that solves everything. There is no overnight success. But there are tested techniques that, when used consistently, build the momentum of an organization until it is unstoppable. It takes a certain amount of toughness to get there, and Michael Kors said it best, \u201cfashion is not for sissies.\u201d Collaborators include: Albert Puyol - CEO - LVMH, Women'secret, Brownie Nikhil Nathwani - Retail Director - CH Carolina Herrera, Swarovski, The Body Shop Camilla Amalie Wildfang - Design Manager - Bestseller HK Limited",

    "description": "Much criticism has been directed at negative stereotypes of Appalachia perpetuated by movies, television shows, and news media. Books, on the other hand, often draw enthusiastic praise for their celebration of the simplicity and authenticity of the Appalachian region. Dear Appalachia: Readers, Identity, and Popular Fiction since 1878 employs the innovative new strategy of examining fan mail, reviews, and readers\u2019 geographic affiliations to understand how readers have imagined the region and what purposes these imagined geographies have served for them. As Emily Satterwhite traces the changing visions of Appalachia across the decades, from the Gilded Age (1865\u20131895) to the present, she finds that every generation has produced an audience hungry for a romantic version of Appalachia. According to Satterwhite, best-selling fiction has portrayed Appalachia as a distinctive place apart from the mainstream United States, has offered cosmopolitan white readers a sense of identity and community, and has engendered feelings of national and cultural pride. Thanks in part to readers\u2019 faith in authors as authentic representatives of the regions they write about, Satterwhite argues, regional fiction often plays a role in creating and affirming regional identity. By mapping the geographic locations of fans, Dear Appalachia demonstrates that mobile white readers in particular, including regional elites, have idealized Appalachia as rooted, static, and protected from commercial society in order to reassure themselves that there remains an \u201cauthentic\u201d America untouched by global currents. Investigating texts such as John Fox Jr.\u2019s The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1908), Harriette Arnow\u2019s The Dollmaker (1954), James Dickey\u2019s Deliverance (1970), and Charles Frazier\u2019s Cold Mountain (1997), Dear Appalachia moves beyond traditional studies of regional fiction to document the functions of these narratives in the lives of readers, revealing not only what people have thought about Appalachia, but why.",

    "description": "Traditionally, control in organizations is concerned with top-down approaches, where executives attempt to direct their employees\u2019 attention, behaviors, and performance to align with the organization\u2019s goals and objectives. This book takes a new approach by turning the problem of control upside down as it focuses on control of executives who find white-collar crime convenient. The bottom-up approach to executive compliance focuses on organizational measures to make white-collar crime less convenient for potential offenders. Rather than focusing on the regulatory formalities and staged procedures of compliance and audits, the book emphasizes the organizational challenges involved in compliance work when trusted corporate officials exhibit deviant behavior, refining, and advancing knowledge in this field by reference to contemporary international case studies and associated original evaluative research. The themes and cases covered are carefully selected to provide the reader with an insight into professional conduct and procedural practice \u2013 the organization of corporate compliance success, failure, and corruption \u2013 with the theory of convenience placed at the fore. It is the bottom-up approach by application of convenience theory that makes the proposed book unique compared to other books on corporate compliance. This book is a valuable resource for scholars and upper-level students researching and studying in the areas of business administration, organizational behavior, corporate and white-collar crime, as well as business ethics and auditing.",

    "description": "Cultural Capitalism explores Russian literature's eager embrace of capitalism in the post-Soviet era. When the Soviet Union fell, books were suddenly bought and sold as commodities. Russia's first bestseller lists brought attention and prestige. Even literary prizes turned to the market for legitimacy. The rise of capitalism entirely transformed both the economics and the aesthetics of Russian literature. By reconstructing the market's influence on everything from late-Soviet paper shortages to the prose of neoimperialism, Cultural Capitalism reveals Russian literature's exuberant hopes for and deep disappointments in capitalism. Only a free market, it was hoped, could cure endemic book deficits and liberate literature from ideological constraints. But as the market came to dominate literature, it imposed an ideology of its own, one that directed literary development for decades. Through archival research, original interviews, and provocative readings of literary texts, Bradley A. Gorski immerses the reader in both the economic and aesthetic worlds of post-Soviet Russian literature to reveal a cultural logic dominated by capitalism. The Russian 1990s and early 2000s saw markets introduced, adopted, and debated at an accelerated pace, all against the backdrop of a socialist past, staging the polemics between capitalism and culture in high drama and sharp relief. But the market forces at the center of the post-Soviet transition are fundamental to cultural trends worldwide. By revealing the complexities of Russia's story, Cultural Capitalism mounts a critique that cuts across national borders and provides a new way of seeing culture in the post-1989 era worldwide.",

The holiday film A Christmas Story, first released in 1983, has become a bona fide Christmas perennial, gaining in stature and fame with each succeeding year. Its affectionate, wacky, and wryly realistic portrayal of an American family\u2019s typical Christmas joys and travails in small-town Depression-era Indiana has entered our imagination and our hearts with a force equal to It\u2019s a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street. This edition of A Christmas Story gathers together in one hilarious volume the gems of autobiographical humor that Jean Shepherd drew upon to create this enduring film. Here is young Ralphie Parker\u2019s shocking discovery that his decoder ring is really a device to promote Ovaltine; his mother and father\u2019s pitched battle over the fate of a lascivious leg lamp; the unleashed and unnerving savagery of Ralphie\u2019s duel in the show with the odious bullies Scut Farkas and Grover Dill; and, most crucially, Ralphie\u2019s unstoppable campaign to get Santa\u2014or anyone else\u2014to give him a Red Ryder carbine action 200-shot range model air rifle. Who cares that the whole adult world is telling him, \u201cYou\u2019ll shoot your eye out, kid\u201d? The pieces that comprise A Christmas Story, previously published in the larger collections In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash and Wanda Hickey\u2019s Night of Golden Memories, coalesce in a magical fashion to become an irresistible piece of Americana, quite the equal of the film in its ability to warm the heart and tickle the funny bone.",

    "description": "In the world of books and literature, \u201chype\u201d is associated with bestsellerism - the books that sell the most, are read by vast numbers, and constantly talked about in media and staff rooms. Often, it is the success in itself that generates an interest because popularity begets popularity. Quite often though, a hyped bestseller is met with a skeptic criticism of poor language, a badly constructed plot, a predictable story line, or all three. The bestseller phenomenon is sometimes conceived as a threat against \u201creal\u201d literature. Research into the creation, reception, and meaning of bestsellers is utterly scarce and Hype: Bestsellers and Literary Culture is an important contribution to the understanding of the literature read by the masses. Popular literature plays an important role in the lives of millions of readers, offering entertainment, social commentary, and alternate perspectives on everyday life. This volume brings together such diverse issues as the creation of hype, the role and the meaning of the author in the present-day media landscape, changes in the book trade, and the relationship between bestsellers and research into them. Further articles give an historical overview on postapocalyptic stories, desert romances and the role of the authors. This book offers new knowledge on a subject that is increasingly popular within university curricula. Although the anthology is a work of academic research the texts are of equal interest to general readers.",

    "description": "Shining a spotlight on everyday readers of the 21st century, Beth Driscoll explores how contemporary readers of Anglophone fiction interact with the book industry, digital environments, and each other. We live in an era when book clubs, bibliomemoirs, Bookstagram and BookTok are as valuable to some readers as solitary reading moments. The product of nearly two decades of qualitative research into readers and reading culture, What Readers Do examines reading through three dimensions - aesthetic conduct, moral conduct, and self-care \u0096 to show how readers intertwine private and social behaviors, and both reinforce and oppose the structures of capitalism. Analyzing reading as a post-digital practice that is a synthesis of both print and digital modes and on- and offline behaviors, Driscoll presents a methodology for studying readers that connects book history, literary studies, sociology, and actor-network theory. Arguing for the vitality, agency, and creativity of readers, this book sheds light on how we read now - and on how much more readers do than just read.",

    "description": "Since the late nineteenth century, religiously themed books in America have been commercially popular yet scorned by critics. Working at the intersection of literary history, lived religion, and consumer culture, Erin A. Smith considers the largely unexplored world of popular religious books, examining the apparent tension between economic and religious imperatives for authors, publishers, and readers. Smith argues that this literature served as a form of extra-ecclesiastical ministry and credits the popularity and longevity of religious books to their day-to-day usefulness rather than their theological correctness or aesthetic quality. Drawing on publishers' records, letters by readers to authors, promotional materials, and interviews with contemporary religious-reading groups, Smith offers a comprehensive study that finds surprising overlap across the religious spectrum--Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish, liberal and conservative. Smith tells the story of how authors, publishers, and readers reconciled these books' dual function as best-selling consumer goods and spiritually edifying literature. What Would Jesus Read? will be of interest to literary and cultural historians, students in the field of print culture, and scholars of religious studies.",

    "description": "Children's book awards have mushroomed since the early twentieth-century and especially since the 1960s, when literary prizing became a favored strategy for both commercial promotion and canon-making. There are over 300 awards for English-language titles alone, but despite the profound impact of children\u2019s book awards, scholars have paid relatively little attention to them. This book is the first scholarly volume devoted to the analysis of Anglophone children's book awards in historical and cultural context. With attention to both political and aesthetic concerns, the book offers original and diverse scholarship on prizing practices and their consequences in Australia, Canada, and especially the United States. Contributors offer both case studies of particular awards and analysis of broader trends in literary evaluation and elevation, drawing on theoretical work on canonization and cultural capital. Sections interrogate the complex and often unconscious ideological work of prizing, the ongoing tension between formalist awards and so-called identity-based awards \u2014 all the more urgent in light of the \"We Need Diverse Books\" campaign \u2014 the ever-morphing forms and parameters of prizing, and scholarly practices of prizing. Among the many awards discussed are the Pura Belpr\u00e9 Medal, the Inky Awards, the Canada Governor General Literary Award, the Printz Award, the Best Animated Feature Oscar, the Phoenix Award, and the John Newbery Medal, giving due attention to prizes for fiction as well as for non-fiction, poetry, and film. This volume will interest scholars in literary and cultural studies, social history, book history, sociology, education, library and information science, and anyone concerned with children's literature.",

Elizabeth Woodville is a woman of extraordinary beauty and ambition. Her mother is Jacquetta, also known as the mystical lady of the rivers, and she is even more determined to bring power and wealth to the family line. While riding in the woods one day, Elizabeth captures the attentions of the newly crowned King Edward IV and, despite her common upbringing, marries him in secret. When she is raised up to be his queen, the English court is outraged, but Elizabeth rises to the demands of her exalted position and fights for her family\u2019s dominance. Yet despite her best efforts, and even with the help of her mother\u2019s powers, her two sons become pawns in a famous unsolved mystery that has confounded historians for centuries: the lost princes in the Tower of London.

    "description": "Witnessing the end of a war that nearly terminated the nation, the abolition of racial slavery and rise of legal segregation, the rise of Modernism and Hollywood, the closing of the frontier and two World Wars, the literary historical period represented in this volume constitutes the crucible of American literary history. Here, 35 essays by top researchers in the field detail how considerations of race and citizenship; immigration and assimilation; gender and sexuality; nationalism and empire; all reverberate throughout novels written in the United States between 1870 and 1940. Contributors discuss the professionalization of literary production after the Civil War alongside legal and political debates over segregation and citizenship; while chapters on journalism, geography, religion, and immigration offer discussions on everything from the lasting role of literary realism in American fiction to the Spanish-American War's effect on developing theories of aesthetics and popular culture. The volume offers thorough coverage of the emergence of serial fiction, children's fiction, crime and detective fiction, science fiction, and even cinema and comics, as new media and artistic revolutions like the Harlem Renaissance helped usher in the new international aesthetic movement of Modernism. The final chapters in the volume explore the relationship of the novel to the emergence of \"American literature\" as a category in the academy, in public criticism and journalism, and in mass culture.",

Decades before Real Housewives, rags-to-riches fantasies depicting strong women overcoming tragedy to take charge of their destinies were a big hit with TV audiences. Reflecting the \"greed is good\" ethos of the day and encoded with feminist messaging, these glitzy, often camp stories depicted statuesque superwomen facing off with square-jawed men in boardrooms and bedrooms. This book explores the shows that epitomized the prime-time soap era and gave us such memorable scenes as Stefanie Powers trading lovers with her twin sister, Joan Collins fighting Nazis in haute couture and Phoebe Cates demanding, \"Which one of you bitches is my mother?\"",

    "description": "This open access book consolidates a collection of scholarly papers presented at the academic conference titled \"Corporate Human Rights Responsibility in OECD Case Law: Actors, Issues, Responsibilities, and Remedies\", held on 4 and 5 May 2023. The conference was organized by the OECD Case Law Project at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg. The book is divided into three sections. The first examines how NCP cases interpret corporate responsibilities, including financial institutions, on human rights and environmental issues, focusing on climate change and conflict-affected zones. It also highlights how OECD cases address corporate accountability and its impact on the revised OECD Guidelines and the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). The second section critically evaluates the NCP mechanism's effectiveness, assessing whether it provides substantive remedies and how well NCP mediation resolves disputes. It offers both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the grievance processes in line with UNGP effectiveness criteria. The third section explores the NCP\u2019s role in global corporate responsibility frameworks, particularly its potential influence on shaping mandatory due diligence obligations through frameworks like the CSDDD, reinforcing corporate accountability in international business practices. Additionally, the book offers key recommendations for policymakers, NCP experts, and practitioners on improving the NCP system to ensure more meaningful outcomes for human rights violations.",

Rupert is consumed by one obsession: that Love Rat, his adored grey horse, be proclaimed champion stallion. He longs to trounce Roberto's Revenge, the stallion owned by his detested rival Cosmo Rannaldini, which means abandoning his racing empire at Penscombe and his darling wife Taggie, and chasing winners in the richest races worldwide, from Dubai to Los Angeles to Melbourne. Luckily, the fort at home is held by Rupert's assistant Gav, a genius with horses, fancied by every stable lass, but damaged by alcoholism and a vile wife. When Gala, a grieving but ravishing Zimbabwean widow moves to Penscombe as carer for Rupert's wayward father, it is not just Gav who is attracted to her: a returning Rupert finds himself dangerously tempted. Gala adores horses, and when she switches to working in the yard, her carer's job is taken by a devastatingly handsome South African man who claims to be gay but seems far keener on caring for the angelic Taggie. And as increasingly sinister acts of sabotage strike at Penscombe, the game of musical loose boxes gathers apace . . . ----------------------------------- 'Packed with warmth, wit, and unforgettable characters, this is an utterly joyous read' Daily Express 'Pure, unadulterated joy' Sophie Kinsella 'It's Cooper doing what she does best ... it's a thoroughly enjoyable roll in the hay' The Times 'Witty and wonderful, as always' Trisha Ashley 'This endlessly fun humdinger of a novel is an absolute riot' Heat",

    "description": "In this latest installment in Alexander McCall Smith's cherished No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, two confounding cases compete for Mma Ramotswe's attention\u2014and she may need to call in back up. Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B Matekoni are enjoying a nice meal out at a peri-peri restaurant when an American woman named Julia approaches seeking Mma Ramotswe's help. Julia's beloved late grandfather was Botswanan, and he instilled in her an abiding love of his homeland. Now, years after his passing and during a rough patch in her own life, Julia has come to visit the land he had spoken of so often and to find her relatives. Unfortunately, her grandfather's stories, while remarkably charming and entertaining, were somewhat light on detail; all Julia can remember are a few first names and some descriptions of his village. It's not a lot to go on, but if anyone is well poised to help, it's Mma Ramotswe, Botswana's premier detective. Meanwhile, a second case leads Mma Ramotswe to look for support from an unexpected quarter. For the first time ever, assistant detective Charlie leads his own investigation at the agency, going undercover into a dubious, word-of-mouth get-together known as the Cool Singles Evening Club, where married men are encouraged to pretend to be single and meet women under false pretenses. Who could be behind such a distasteful venture? Getting to the bottom of this will be a tall order, to be sure, but Charlie is eager for the opportunity. As Mma Ramotswe learns more about Julia, she begins to understand that Julia's heartbreak runs deeper than she had initially realized. Together, Mma Ramotswe and Mma Potokwane must find a way to help their client heal and move forward\u2014from both her past and her present. Julia had originally come to Botswana seeking family and connection, but in the warm embrace of Mma Ramotswe and Mma Potokwane, what she ends up finding is a home.",

SAMPLE EXCERPT: \u201cWhat was the inspiration behind the creation of this book?\u201d Although many people have expressed how much Bared to You resembles Fifty Shades of Grey, Day said in interviews that her real inspiration for writing this book is her own novel, Seven Years to Sin. It is a historical novel also dealing with a couple recovering from difficult, abusive pasts. In Seven Years to Sin, the main characters were brought together by their histories. But Day wondered how it would be like if the past of two people very attracted to each other push them apart. What if their trauma inhibits them from connecting with the person they are in love with? Can an abuse survivor be able to have a functional and healthy romantic relationship with another abuse survivor? Day wanted to explore that. This premise, the desire to answer these questions at least in the context of a story, resulted in the plotline that will encompass the three books in the Crossfire series. - - - - - Don't miss out! It's highly recommended. if you're a real literature junkie or a diehard fan of the novel (I am both) it's really a must read. Highly recommended. - ForTheQuinn (Austin, TX, US) Disclaimer: This work is not meant to replace, but to complement the original work. If you've loved the novel, then this is the book for you. It is educational in purpose, entertaining in nature, unauthorized and unofficial. It is a digestive work produced to stimulate the appetite and to encourage readers to appreciate the original work even more.",

    "description": "An affordable, concise survey on the influential modernist designer's interiors, buildings, furniture and more, from a sawtooth ski resort to sculptural chaises longues From the onset of her career, Charlotte Perriand was a maverick who believed in good design as a force for the betterment of society. Many young designers would be devastated by a rejection from Le Corbusier's studio, but when the great architect told her they had no use for a female furniture designer, Perriand only became more determined to prove her mettle as an artist. Under Le Corbusier, and long after she left his studio, Perriand's contributions to both furniture design and architecture demonstrated a unique attention to the organic artistry of nature as well as the egalitarian possibilities of the machine age. Her leftwing populist politics motivated much of her work, from modular furniture systems to major architectural projects. This monograph explores Perriand's most famous interiors, original furniture and architectural projects, as well as her never-before-seen sketchbooks, shedding new light on her creative process and place in design history. Charlotte Perriand (1903-99) experienced the first breakthrough in her career with Le Bar sous le toit, a 1927 interior design piece that predicted the elegant minimalism and utilitarian nature of her future work. Although today she is perhaps best known for her early chaise longue designs, Perriand also created the plans for a number of major buildings across Europe and contributed interior designs to Le Corbusier's Unit d'habitation. She worked in places as diverse as Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and London in her pursuit of accessible design.",

FRANCE, 1939 In the quiet village of Carriveau, Vianne Mauriac says goodbye to her husband, Antoine, as he heads for the Front. She doesn't believe that the Nazis will invade France...but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne's home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive. Vianne's sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old girl, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets G\u00e4etan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can...completely. But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others. With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of WWII and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women's war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France--a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women. It is a novel for everyone, a novel for a lifetime.",

    "description": "From America's most beloved superstar and #1 New York Times bestselling author James Patterson comes a thriller about a young singer-songwriter on the rise--and on the run--and determined to do whatever it takes to survive. A new singer arrives in Nashville. She calls herself AnnieLee Keyes, and she has more beauty, talent, and ambition than most -- and a dangerous past that she's running from. Her performance of original songs at open-mic night at the Cat's Paw Saloon downtown transfixes Ethan Blake, back-up musician for country star Ruthanna Ryder. Ruthanna may have retired--for deeply personal reasons--but that doesn't mean she's stopped writing music. Every day, she records songs she'll never release. When Ruthanna hears AnnieLee sing, the legend decides to help the ingenue. But a boost from a mega-star like Ruthanna may spotlight the talented newcomer's secret. Now AnnieLee may not live long enough to realize her dreams of stardom--or for the world to learn her true identity.",

    "description": "The Frankfurt Book Fair is the leading global industry venue for rights sales, facilitating business-to-buzzness deals and international networks. In this Element, we pursue an Ullapoolist approach to excavate beneath the production of bestsellers at the Fair. Our investigation involved three consecutive years of fieldwork (2017\u20132019) including interviews and autoethnographic, arts-informed interventions. The Element argues that buzz at the Fair exists in two states: as market-ready media reports and partial, lived experiences linked to mood. The physical structures and absences of the Fair enact its power relations and direct the flow of books and buzz. Further, the Fair is not only a site for commercial exchange but a carnival of sorts, marked by disruptive historical events and problematic socio-political dynamics. Key themes emerging from the Element are the presence of excess, the pseudo(neo)liberal self-satisfaction of book culture, and the interplay of optimism and pessimism in contemporary publishing.",
